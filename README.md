# An Agda formalization of the Ouroboros Praos consensus protocol

## Overview

This repository includes an Agda mechanization of the Ouroboros Praos consensus
protocol as specified in [[1]](#1).

## Contents

The repository contains the formalization of the consensus protocol and the corresponding safety proof, which are based on the work in [[2]](#2).

## Development

You can enter a development shell suitable for Agda using the following command:

```bash
nix-shell
```
